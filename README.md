<h1>Description</h1>
<h3>HomeScreen</h3>
<p>The homescreen is basically the presentation of our api in where we show an image in relation of the information inside, in this case, the example of the rick and morty api.</p>
<h3>CharacterList</h3>
<p>Once we already seen the first image, we are going to see a list of the characters that we want, depending of the page that we ask in the code, my case is the page 2, showing some relevant data about the character, all this information in a column form.</p>
<h3>CharacterDetail</h3>
<p>Now, when we want more certain information about an specific character, we can select the character of our preference and then are going to move to another page in which we will see more information of our character and the image with other style.</p>
<h3>SearchCharacter</h3>
<p>In this part, instead of look in the whole list, we can just use the search part in the top of the screen, and then just type the name of the character and see if there is in existence and just select it or not.</p>
